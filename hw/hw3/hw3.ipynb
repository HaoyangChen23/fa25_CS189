        "\n",
        "Our model needs some way to build a computation graph for backpropagation so that it knows where to pass down gradients during the backwards pass. The way that PyTorch does this, is that every time you combine two values to compute a third one in the forward pass, it will keep track of this internally. We want to implement a similar functionality for `BearTensor`; everytime we add, subtract, divide, etc. two `BearTensor` to get a third one, we should keep track of the fact that the third tensor's **parents** are the two source tensors. \n",
        "\n",
        "Here is an example of what a computation graph might look like from lecture:\n",

        "  <img src=\"https://imgur.com/PO3S6TI.png\" alt=\"Backpropagation\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 60%;\">\n",
        "</div>\n",
        "\n",
        "**Your Task**:\n",
        "\n",
        "Currently, our `BearTensor` has no operations. Implement the following functions in the class:\n",
        "- Addition (`__add__`)\n",
        "- Subtraction (`__sub__`)\n",
        "- Multiplication (`__mul__`)\n",
        "- Power (`__pow__`)\n",
        "- Matrix multiplication (`__matmul__`)\n",
        "- Dot product (`dot`)\n",
        "- Sum (`sum`)\n",
        "- Mean (`mean`)\n",
        "- ReLU (`relu`)\n",
        "- Sigmoid (`sigmoid`)\n",
        "\n",
        "A few things to remember:\n",
        "1. You should return a new `BearTensor` from these functions without modifying the existing one\n",
        "2. Remember to set the parents of this new Tensor to be the two source tensors; this is how we will build a computation graph\n",
        "3. Remember to set the correct gradient function as the first argument of `BearParent.BearGrad`; this will tell us how to compute the downstream gradient during the backward pass\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, we are going to be doing a lot NumPy operations in this Homework. It is important that you think about how the shapes of different arrays will change due to NumPy broadcasting rules, and reshape when needed. Some examples of this that are relevant to this HW are:\n",
        "- NumPy will automatically broadcast 1-element arrays to a scalar (ex. when computing the dot product of two vectors)\n",
        "- NumPy will broadcast array of shape (N, 1) to just (N,) (ex. when a matrix times a matrix gives a vector)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note**: The public tests that we've provided in this notebook are NOT fully-comprehensive and often very simple. You should build more complex graphs and manually verify that your computed gradients and values are correct. Our hidden tests are more comprehensive and will check for full correctness \n"

        "\n",
        "After solving the previous question, your `BearTensor` should be able to construct the computation graph from the forward pass. In this part, we will implement the backwards pass, using the `BearGrad` functionality from above to propagate the gradients downstream.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conceptual Overview**\n",
        "\n",
        "When training networks, we want to backpropagate the gradients starting from the very final node, which produced our training loss. To do this efficiently, we adopt a recursive approach; the loss node propagates its gradient back to its parent nodes. Then, every parent node propagates its gradient one layer further back; we keep recursively doing this until gradients have been propagated across the whole computation graph.\n",
        "\n",
        "In lecture, we implemented single-variable `autograd` with two passes when `.backward()` is called: \n",
        "a \"reset\" pass that sets up counters for each node in our computational graph, \n",
        "and then a recursive backward pass to iterate through the entire graph and accumulate each node's adjoint.\n",
        "\n",
        "We can actually perform both of these steps at once using an algorithm called <i>topological sort</i>.\n",
        "This addresses the core problem we are trying to solve: a node can only propagate its gradient backward after it has received gradients from all its children.\n",
        "\n",
        "[Topological sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting) starts from the root node (where we call\n",
        "`.backward()`), and traverses our computational graph to determine a correct order of operations. From Wikipedia: \n",
        "it provides a linear ordering that ensures that for any edge $u \\to v$ in our computational graph, $u$ comes before\n",
        "$v$ in the ordering. It turns out that *depth-first search (DFS)* actually gives us a topological sort!\n",
        "\n",
        "You should first implement topological sort, then backprop; this ensures that for deep networks we do not encounter a stack overflow error. One implementation of this is [Kahn's algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/topological-sorting-indegree-based-solution/) which is iterative instead of recursive, avoiding stack overflow errors for deep networks. Alternatively, you can use the implementation discussed in lecture.\n",

        "**Your Task:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Fill out `topological_sort` first, then `reset_children`, and `backward` below to implement backpropagation. After completing this, you finally have your very own PyTorch implementation!"

        "\n",
        "In this section, we're going to use the backpropagation engine and optimizers you created to train a model to predict wine quality scores!\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conceptual Overview:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Unfortunately, training our model is going to be slightly more involved than just using PyTorch. Our simple implementation does not allow us to define layers. Instead, we are going to define `BearTensors`, combine them manually to do a forward pass (which will automatically construct a computation graph!) and then finally backpropagate on our loss.\n",
        "\n",
        "We are going to use the Wine Quality dataset, which contains 1599 samples of red wine. Each sample has 11 features representing various chemical properties, and the task is to predict the wine quality score (between 0 and 10). You can choose any loss function and optimizer (as long as you implemented it!) of your choice, feel free to play around with hyperparameters and different model sizes!\n",
        "\n",
        "**Your Tasks:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Train a model to predict wine quality scores. Your model should:\n",
        "- Use at least one hidden layer\n",
        "- Use an activation function for hidden layers\n",
        "- Achieve a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of ≤ 2.0 on the dataset\n",
        "\n",
        "**You need to fill in the `predict()` function that uses your architecture to return a prediction given an input datapoint. The autograder will use this to test your implementation**.\n",
        "\n",
